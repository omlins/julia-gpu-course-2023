We will now explicitly control part of the the on-chip memory usage, using so called \"shared memory\", which is repurposed high-level cache. This will give some insights on how certain parameters relate to on-chip memory usage. However, we will not implement a diffusion kernel with shared memory at once, but in little steps.\n",
